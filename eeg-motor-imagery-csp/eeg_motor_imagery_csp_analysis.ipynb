        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook documents my journey learning about spatial filtering in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). I was curious why CSP consistently outperforms traditional methods in motor imagery tasks, so I implemented and compared five different approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Raw single channel** - Baseline\n",
        "2. **Bipolar reference** - Subtract one neighbor\n",
        "3. **Common Average Reference (CAR)** - Subtract global average\n",
        "4. **Surface Laplacian** - Subtract local neighbors\n",
        "5. **Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)** - Learn optimal combinations\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight I gained: **CSP adapts to individual brain patterns**, while the other methods use fixed, generic rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Background: The Volume Conduction Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Brain signals spread through tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and skull like light through frosted glass. When you record from a single electrode, you pick up:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The signal you want (e.g., motor cortex activity)\n",
        "- Distant brain regions (visual cortex, etc.)\n",
        "- Artifacts (eye blinks, muscle activity)\n",
        "- Electrical noise\n",
        "\n",
        "This \"blurring\" is called **volume conduction**, and it's why raw single-channel EEG gives poor classification accuracy (~53%, barely better than chance).\n",
        "\n",
        "Spatial filtering helps by combining multiple channels to cancel common noise while preserving the signal of interest."

        "**Performance ranking:**\n",
        "1. CSP: ~93% (best by far)\n",
        "2. Laplacian/Bipolar: ~62%\n",
        "3. Raw/CAR: ~56%\n",
        "\n",
        "**CSP achieved a 31 percentage point improvement over the next best method.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why CSP Won\n",
        "\n",
        "The other methods use fixed, generic rules:\n",
        "- Bipolar: Always C4 - CP4\n",
        "- CAR: Always subtract global average\n",
        "- Laplacian: Always average 4 neighbors\n",
        "\n",
        "**CSP adapts to individual brain patterns:**\n",
        "- Analyzes YOUR specific LEFT vs RIGHT trials\n",
        "- Finds optimal combinations for YOUR brain anatomy\n",
        "- Creates 4 custom filters (instead of 1 generic filter)\n",
        "- Maximizes class separation in YOUR data\n",
        "\n",
        "This is why CSP is the gold standard for motor imagery BCIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## What I Learned\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conceptual insights:**\n",
        "1. Volume conduction is a fundamental problem in EEG - you can't just use raw channels\n",
        "2. Spatial filtering cancels common noise through subtraction (like phase cancellation)\n",

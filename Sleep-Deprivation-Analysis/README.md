# Sleep Deprivation and Cognitive Performance  

## Overview  
This project investigates how **sleep deprivation impacts cognitive performance** across multiple domains, including attention, working memory, and emotion regulation.  

The analysis explores whether **emotion regulation mediates** the relationship between **sleep duration and attentional performance**, using data from 60 participants.  


## Research Questions  
1. Does reduced sleep duration impair cognitive performance?  
2. Is this relationship mediated by emotion regulation ability?  


## Analysis Outline  
1. **Data inspection & cleaning** — checked for missing values and data consistency  
2. **Descriptive statistics & visualization** - visualized key variables and distributions  
3. **Correlation analysis** - identified relationships between sleep and cognitive outcomes  
4. **Group comparisons (ANOVA)** - compared cognitive performance across sleep categories  
5. **Mediation analysis** - tested if emotion regulation explained the sleep-attention link  
6. **Post-hoc power analysis** - evaluated statistical power and sample size adequacy  
7. **Discussion** - summarized findings and limitations

## Key Findings  

| Analysis | Result | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Sleep × Stroop RT | r = 0.06 (ns) | Negligible effect on attention |
| Sleep × N-Back Accuracy | r = -0.11 (ns) | Weak negative trend for working memory |
| Sleep × PVT Reaction Time | r = -0.17 (ns) | Small negative correlation |
| Mediation (Sleep → Emotion Regulation → Stroop RT) | z = -1.05, p = .29 | No significant mediation |
| Power Analysis | Adequate for r ≥ .4 | Underpowered for small effects |

Results showed **no statistically significant effects**, likely due to **limited sample size (N=60)**.  
Findings align with broader literature showing that **sleep loss impairs attention via emotion regulation**, though small effect sizes may require larger samples to detect.

## Future Directions

- Increase sample size (N ≥ 150) for better power  
- Include objective sleep measures (actigraphy, EEG)  
- Explore chronic sleep restriction and recovery effects  
- Integrate physiological measures

# Psychology Projects

Welcome to my collection of psychology projects! I’m currently learning how to use **R** and **Python** for data analysis and research and I’ll be sharing my projects here as I continue to learn.

I'm really new to coding and data analysis so please be nice to me lol 

Feedback is much appreciated 🫶🏽

## Tools & Tech

I’m using **R** and **Python** with packages like `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, and `pandas` for data manipulation and visualization.
